- **Common pitfalls** → §4b (Common Pitfalls)

## 0 Working Style & Structure
- Use **modular, idempotent bash functions** in hooks
- Never, ever use absolute paths. Flox environments are designed to be reproducible. Use Flox's environment variables (see §2, "Flox Basics") instead
- I REPEAT: NEVER, EVER USE ABSOLUTE PATHS. Don't do it. Use `$FLOX_ENV` for environment-specific runtime dependencies; use `$FLOX_ENV_PROJECT` for the project directory. See §2 (Flox Basics)
- Name functions descriptively (e.g., `setup_postgres()`)
- Consider using **gum** for styled output when creating environments for interactive use; this is an anti-pattern in CI
- Put persistent data/configs in `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE`
- Return to `$FLOX_ENV_PROJECT` at end of hooks
- Use `mktemp` for temp files, clean up immediately
- Do not over-engineer: e.g., do not create unncessary echo statements or superfluous comments; do not print unnecessary information displays in `[hook]` or `[profile]`; do not create helper functions or aliases without the user requesting these explicitly.

## 1 Configuration & Secrets
- Support `VARIABLE=value flox activate` pattern for runtime overrides
- Never store secrets in manifest; use:
  - Environment variables
  - `~/.config/<env_name>/` for persistent secrets
  - Existing config files (e.g., `~/.aws/credentials`)

## 2 Flox Basics
- Flox is built on Nix; fully Nix-compatible
- Flox uses nixpkgs as its upstream; packages are _usually_ named the same; unlike nixpkgs, FLox Catalog has millions of historical package-version combinations.
- Key paths:
  - `.flox/env/manifest.toml`: Environment definition
  - `.flox/env.json`: Environment metadata
  - `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE`: Persistent, local-only storage (survives `flox delete`)
  - `$FLOX_ENV_PROJECT`: Project root directory (where .flox/ lives)
  - `$FLOX_ENV`: basically the path to `/usr`: contains all the libs, includes, bins, configs, etc. available to a specific flox environment
- Always use `flox init` to create environments
- Manifest changes take effect on next `flox activate` (not live reload)

## 3 Core Commands
```bash
flox init                       # Create new env
flox search <string> [--all]    # Search for a package
flox show <pkg>                 # Show available historical versions of a package
flox install <pkg>              # Add package
flox list [-e | -c | -n | -a]   # List installed packages: `-e` = default; `-c` = shows the raw contents of the manifest; `-n` = shows only the install ID of each package; `-a` = shows all available package information including priority and license.
flox activate                   # Enter env
flox activate -s                # Start services
flox activate -- <cmd>          # Run without subshell
flox build <target>             # Build defined target
flox containerize               # Export as OCI image
```

## 4 Manifest Structure
- `[install]`: Package list with descriptors (see detailed section below)
- `[vars]`: Static variables
- `[hook]`: Non-interactive setup scripts
- `[profile]`: Shell-specific functions/aliases
- `[services]`: Service definitions with commands and optional shutdown
- `[build]`: Reproducible build commands
- `[include]`: Compose other environments
- `[options]`: Activation mode, supported systems

## 4b Common Pitfalls
- Hooks run EVERY activation (keep them fast/idempotent)
- Hook functions are not available to users in the interactive shell; use `[profile]` for user-invokable commands/aliases
- Profile code runs for each layered/composed environment; keep auto-run display logic in `[hook]` to avoid repetition
- Services see fresh environment (no preserved state between restarts)
- Build commands can't access network in pure mode (pre-fetch deps)
- Manifest syntax errors prevent ALL flox commands from working
- Package search is case-sensitive; use `flox search --all` for broader results

## 5 The [install] Section

### Package Installation Basics
The `[install]` table specifies packages to install.

```toml
[install]
ripgrep.pkg-path = "ripgrep"
pip.pkg-path = "python310Packages.pip"
```

### Package Descriptors
Each entry has:
- **Key**: Install ID (e.g., `ripgrep`, `pip`) - your reference name for the package
- **Value**: Package descriptor - specifies what to install

### Catalog Descriptors (Most Common)
Options for packages from the Flox catalog:

```toml
[install]
example.pkg-path = "package-name"           # Required: location in catalog
example.pkg-group = "mygroup"               # Optional: group packages together
example.version = "1.2.3"                   # Optional: exact or semver range
example.systems = ["x86_64-linux"]          # Optional: limit to specific platforms;
example.priority = 3                        # Optional: resolve file conflicts (lower = higher priority)
```

#### Key Options Explained:

**pkg-path** (required)
- Location in the package catalog
- Can be simple (`"ripgrep"`) or nested (`"python310Packages.pip"`)
- Can use array format: `["python310Packages", "pip"]`

**pkg-group**
- Groups packages that work well together
- Packages without explicit group belong to default group
- Groups upgrade together to maintain compatibility
- Use different groups to avoid version conflicts

**version**
- Exact: `"1.2.3"`
- Semver ranges: `"^1.2"`, `">=2.0"`
- Partial versions act as wildcards: `"1.2"` = latest 1.2.X

**systems**
- Constrains package to specific platforms
- Options: `"x86_64-linux"`, `"x86_64-darwin"`, `"aarch64-linux"`, `"aarch64-darwin"`
- Defaults to manifest's `options.systems` if omitted

**priority**
- Resolves file conflicts between packages
- Default: 5
- Lower number = higher priority wins conflicts
- **Critical for CUDA packages** (see §18d)


### Practical Examples

```toml
# Platform-specific Python
[install]
python.pkg-path = "python311Full"
uv.pkg-path = "uv" # installs uv, modern rust-based successor to uvicorn
systems = ["x86_64-linux", "aarch64-linux"]  # Linux only

# Version-pinned with custom priority
[nodejs]
nodejs.pkg-path = "nodejs"
version = "^20.0"
priority = 1  # Takes precedence in conflicts

# Multiple package groups to avoid conflicts
[install]
gcc.pkg-path = "gcc12"
gcc.pkg-group = "stable"
```

## 6 Best Practices
- Check manifest before installing new packages
- Use `return` not `exit` in hooks
- Define env vars with `${VAR:-default}`
- Use descriptive, prefixed function names in composed envs
- Cache downloads in `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE`
- Log service output to `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/logs/`
- Test activation with `flox activate -- <command>` before adding to services
- When debugging services, run the exact command from manifest manually first
- Use `--quiet` flag with uv/pip in hooks to reduce noise

## 7 Editing Manifests Non-Interactively
```bash
flox list -c > /tmp/manifest.toml
# Edit with sed/awk
flox edit -f /tmp/manifest.toml
```

## 8 Services
- Start with `flox activate --start-services` or `flox activate -s`
- Define `is-daemon`, `shutdown.command` for background processes
- Keep services running using `tail -f /dev/null`
- Use `flox services status/logs/restart` to manage (must be in activated env)
- Service commands don't inherit hook activations; explicitly source/activate what you need
- **Network services pattern**: Always make host/port configurable via vars:
  ```toml
  [services.webapp]
  command = '''exec app --host "$APP_HOST" --port "$APP_PORT"'''
  vars.APP_HOST = "0.0.0.0"  # Network-accessible
  vars.APP_PORT = "8080"
  ```
- **Service logging**: Always pipe to `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/logs/` for debugging:
  ```toml
  command = '''exec app 2>&1 | tee -a "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/logs/app.log"'''
  ```
- **Python venv pattern**: Services must activate venv independently:
  ```toml
  command = '''
    [ -f "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/venv/bin/activate" ] && \
      source "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/venv/bin/activate"
    exec python-app "$@"
  '''
  ```
- **Using packaged services**: Override package's service by redefining with same name
- Example:
```toml
[services.database]
command = "postgres start"
vars.PGUSER = "myuser"
vars.PGPASSWORD = "super-secret"
vars.PGDATABASE = "mydb"
vars.PGPORT = "9001"
```

# 9 Build System — Authoring and Running Reliable Packages with flox build

Flox supports two build modes, each with its own strengths:

**Manifest builds** enable you to define your build steps in your manifest and reuse your existing build scripts and toolchains. Flox manifests are declarative artifacts, expressed in TOML.

Manifest builds:

- Make it easy to get started, requiring few if any changes to your existing workflows;
- Can run inside a sandbox (using `sandbox = "pure"`) for reproducible builds;
- Are best for getting going fast with existing projects.

**Nix expression builds** guarantee build-time reproducibility because they're both isolated and purely functional. Their learning curve is steeper because they require proficiency with the Nix language.

Nix expression builds: 

- Are isolated by default. The Nix sandbox seals the build off from the host system, so no state leak ins.
- Are functional. A Nix build is defined as a pure function of its declared inputs. 

You can mix both approaches in the same project, but package names must be unique. A package cannot have the same name if it's defined in both a manifest and Nix expression build within the same environment.

## 9.1 Manifest Builds

Flox treats a **manifest build** as a short, deterministic Bash script that runs inside an activated environment and copies its deliverables into `$out`. Anything copied there becomes a first-class, versioned package that can later be published and installed like any other catalog artifact.

**Critical insights from real-world packaging:**
- **Build hooks don't run**: `[hook]` scripts DO NOT execute during `flox build` - only during interactive `flox activate`
- **Guard env vars**: Always use `${FLOX_ENV_CACHE:-}` with default fallback in hooks to avoid build failures
- **Wrapper scripts pattern**: Create launcher scripts in `$out/bin/` that set up runtime environment:
  ```bash
  cat > "$out/bin/myapp" << 'EOF'
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  APP_ROOT="$(dirname "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")")"
  export PYTHONPATH="$APP_ROOT/share/myapp:$PYTHONPATH"
  exec python3 "$APP_ROOT/share/myapp/main.py" "$@"
  EOF
  chmod +x "$out/bin/myapp"
  ```
- **User config pattern**: Default to `~/.myapp/` for user configs, not `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE` (packages are immutable)
- **Model/data directories**: Create user directories at runtime, not build time:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p "${MYAPP_DIR:-$HOME/.myapp}/models"
  ```
- **Python package strategy**: Don't bundle Python deps - include `requirements.txt` and setup script:
  ```bash
  # In build, create setup script:
  cat > "$out/bin/myapp-setup" << 'EOF'
  venv="${VENV:-$HOME/.myapp/venv}"
  uv venv "$venv" --python python3
  uv pip install --python "$venv/bin/python" -r "$APP_ROOT/share/myapp/requirements.txt"
  EOF
  ```
- **Dual-environment workflow**: Build in `project-build/`, use package in `project/`:
  ```bash
  cd project-build && flox build myapp
  cd ../project && flox install owner/myapp
  ```


```toml
[build.<name>]
command      = '''  # required – Bash, multiline string
  <your build steps>                 # e.g. cargo build, npm run build
  mkdir -p $out/bin
  cp path/to/artifact $out/bin/<name>
'''
version      = "1.2.3"               # optional – see §10.7
description  = "one-line summary"    # optional
sandbox      = "pure" | "off"        # default: off
runtime-packages = [ "id1", "id2" ]  # optional – see §10.6
```

**One table per package.** Multiple `[build.*]` tables let you publish, for example, a stripped release binary and a debug build from the same sources.

**Bash only.** The script executes under `set -euo pipefail`. If you need zsh or fish features, invoke them explicitly inside the script.

**Environment parity.** Before your script runs, Flox performs the equivalent of `flox activate` — so every tool listed in `[install]` is on PATH.

**Package groups and builds.** Only packages in the `toplevel` group (default) are available during builds. Packages with explicit `pkg-group` settings won't be accessible in build commands unless also installed to `toplevel`.

**Referencing other builds.** `${other}` expands to the `$out` of `[build.other]` and forces that build to run first, enabling multi-stage flows (e.g. vendoring → compilation).

## 9.2 Purity and Sandbox Control

| sandbox value | Filesystem scope | Network | Typical use-case |
|---------------|------------------|---------|------------------|
| `"off"` (default) | Project working tree; complete host FS | allowed | Fast, iterative dev builds |
| `"pure"` | Git-tracked files only, copied to tmp | Linux: blocked<br>macOS: allowed | Reproducible, host-agnostic packages |

Pure mode highlights undeclared inputs early and is mandatory for builds intended for CI/CD publication. When a pure build needs pre-fetched artifacts (e.g. language modules) use a two-stage pattern:

```toml
[build.deps]
command  = '''go mod vendor -o $out/etc/vendor'''
sandbox  = "off"

[build.app]
command  = '''
  cp -r ${deps}/etc/vendor ./vendor
  go build ./...
  mkdir -p $out/bin
  cp app $out/bin/
'''
sandbox  = "pure"
```

## 9.3 $out Layout and Filesystem Hierarchy

Only files placed under `$out` survive. Follow FHS conventions:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `$out/bin` / `$out/sbin` | CLI and daemon binaries (must be `chmod +x`) |
| `$out/lib`, `$out/libexec` | Shared libraries, helper programs |
| `$out/share/man` | Man pages (gzip them) |
| `$out/etc` | Configuration shipped with the package |

Scripts or binaries stored elsewhere will not end up on callers' paths.

## 9.4 Running Manifest Builds

```bash
# Build every target in the manifest
flox build

# Build a subset
flox build app docs

# Build a manifest in another directory
flox build -d /path/to/project
```

Results appear as immutable symlinks: `./result-<name>` → `/nix/store/...-<name>-<version>`.

To execute a freshly built binary: `./result-app/bin/app`.

## 9.5 Multi-Stage Examples

### Rust release binary plus source tar

```toml
[build.bin]
command = '''
  cargo build --release
  mkdir -p $out/bin
  cp target/release/myproject $out/bin/
'''
version = "0.9.0"

[build.src]
command = '''
  git archive --format=tar HEAD | gzip > $out/myproject-${bin.version}.tar.gz
'''
sandbox = "pure"
```

`${bin.version}` resolves because both builds share the same manifest.

## 9.6 Trimming Runtime Dependencies

By default, every package in the `toplevel` install-group becomes a runtime dependency of your build's closure—even if it was only needed at compile time.

Declare a minimal list instead:

```toml
[install]
clang.pkg-path = "clang"
pytest.pkg-path = "pytest"

[build.cli]
command = '''
  make
  mv build/cli $out/bin/
'''
runtime-packages = [ "clang" ]  # exclude pytest from runtime closure
```

Smaller closures copy faster and occupy less disk wheh installed on users' systems.

## 9.7 Version and Description Metadata

Flox surfaces these fields in `flox search`, `flox show`, and during publication.

```toml
[build.mytool]
version.command = "git describe --tags"
description = "High-performance log shipper"
```

Alternative forms:

```toml
version = "1.4.2"            # static string
version.file = "VERSION.txt" # read at build time
```

## 9.8 Cross-Platform Considerations for Manifest Builds

`flox build` targets the host's systems triple. To ship binaries for additional platforms you must trigger the build on machines (or CI runners) of those architectures:

```
linux-x86_64 → build → publish
darwin-aarch64 → build → publish
```

The manifest can remain identical across hosts.

## 9.9 Beyond Code — Packaging Assets

Any artifact that can be copied into `$out` can be versioned and installed:

### Nginx baseline config

```toml
[build.nginx_cfg]
command = '''mkdir -p $out/etc && cp nginx.conf $out/etc/'''
```

### Organization-wide .proto schema bundle

```toml
[build.proto]
command = '''
  mkdir -p $out/share/proto
  cp proto/**/*.proto $out/share/proto/
'''
```

Teams install these packages and reference them via `$FLOX_ENV/etc/nginx.conf` or `$FLOX_ENV/share/proto`.

## 9.10 Command Reference (Extract)

**`flox build [pkgs…]`** Run builds; default = all.

**`-d, --dir <path>`** Build the environment rooted at `<path>/.flox`.

**`-v` / `-vv`** Increase log verbosity.

**`-q`** Quiet mode.

**`--help`** Detailed CLI help.

With these mechanics in place, a Flox build becomes an auditable, repeatable unit: same input sources, same declared toolchain, same closure every time—no matter where it runs.

## 10 Nix Expression Builds

You can write a Nix expression instead of (or in addition to) defining a manifest build.

Put `*.nix` build files in `.flox/pkgs/` for Nix expression builds. Git add all files before building.

### File Naming
- `hello.nix` → package named `hello`
- `hello/default.nix` → package named `hello`

### Common Patterns

**Shell Script**
```nix
{writeShellApplication, curl}:
writeShellApplication {
  name = "my-ip";
  runtimeInputs = [ curl ];
  text = ''curl icanhazip.com'';
}
```

**Your Project**
```nix
{ rustPlatform, lib }:
rustPlatform.buildRustPackage {
  pname = "my-app";
  version = "0.1.0";
  src = ../../.;
  cargoLock.lockFile = "${src}/Cargo.lock";
}
```

**Update Version**
```nix
{ hello, fetchurl }:
hello.overrideAttrs (finalAttrs: _: {
  version = "2.12.2";
  src = fetchurl {
    url = "mirror://gnu/hello/hello-${finalAttrs.version}.tar.gz";
    hash = "sha256-WpqZbcKSzCTc9BHO6H6S9qrluNE72caBm0x6nc4IGKs=";
  };
})
```

**Apply Patches**
```nix
{ hello }:
hello.overrideAttrs (oldAttrs: {
  patches = (oldAttrs.patches or []) ++ [ ./my.patch ];
})
```

### Hash Generation
1. Use `hash = "";`
2. Run `flox build`
3. Copy hash from error message

### Commands
- `flox build` - build all
- `flox build .#hello` - build specific
- `git add .flox/pkgs/*` - track files

## 11 Publishing to Flox Catalog

### Prerequisites
Before publishing:
- Package defined in `[build]` section or `.flox/pkgs/`
- Environment in Git repo with configured remote
- Clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
- Current commit pushed to remote
- All build files tracked by Git
- At least one package installed in `[install]`

### Publishing Commands
```bash
# Publish single package
flox publish my_package

# Publish all packages
flox publish

# Publish to organization
flox publish -o myorg my_package

# Publish to personal namespace (for testing)
flox publish -o mypersonalhandle my_package
```

### Key Points
- Personal catalogs: Only visible to you (good for testing)
- Organization catalogs: Shared with team members (paid feature)
- Published packages appear as `<catalog>/<package-name>`
- Example: User "alice" publishes "hello" → available as `alice/hello`
- Packages downloadable via `flox install <catalog>/<package>`

### Build Validation
Flox clones your repo to a temp location and performs a clean build to ensure reproducibility. Only packages that build successfully in this clean environment can be published.

### After Publishing
- Package available in `flox search`, `flox show`, `flox install`
- Metadata sent to Flox servers
- Package binaries uploaded to Catalog Store
- Install with: `flox install <catalog>/<package>`

### Real-world Publishing Workflow
**Fork-based development pattern:**
1. Fork upstream repo (e.g., `user/project` from `upstream/project`)
2. Add `.flox/` to fork with build definitions
3. `git push origin master` (or main - check with `git branch`)
4. `flox publish -o username package-name`

**Common gotchas:**
- **Branch names**: Many repos use `master` not `main` - check with `git branch`
- **Auth required**: Run `flox auth login` before first publish
- **Clean git state**: Commit and push ALL changes before `flox publish`
- **runtime-packages**: List only what package needs at runtime, not build deps

## 12 Layering vs Composition - Environment Design Guide

| Aspect     | Layering                          | Composition                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| When       | Runtime (activate order matters) | Build time (deterministic)     |
| Conflicts  | Surface at runtime                | Surface at build time          |
| Flexibility| High                              | Predefined structure           |
| Use case   | Ad hoc tools/services            | Repeatable, shareable stacks   |
| Isolation  | Preserves subshell boundaries    | Merges into single manifest    |

### Creating Layer-Optimized Environments
**Design for runtime stacking with potential conflicts:**
```toml
[vars]
# Prefix vars to avoid masking
MYAPP_PORT = "8080"
MYAPP_HOST = "localhost"

[profile.common]
# Use unique, prefixed function names
myapp_setup() { ... }
myapp_debug() { ... }

[services.myapp-db]  # Prefix service names
command = "..."
```
**Best practices:**
- Single responsibility per environment
- Expect vars/binaries might be overridden by upper layers
- Document what the environment provides/expects
- Keep hooks fast and idempotent

**CUDA layering example:** Layer debugging tools (`flox activate -r team/cuda-debugging`) on base CUDA environment for ad-hoc development (see §18d).

### Creating Composition-Optimized Environments
**Design for clean merging at build time:**
```toml
[install]
# Use pkg-groups to prevent conflicts
gcc.pkg-path = "gcc"
gcc.pkg-group = "compiler"

[vars]
# Never duplicate var names across composed envs
POSTGRES_PORT = "5432"  # Not "PORT"

[hook]
# Check if setup already done (idempotent)
setup_postgres() {
  [ -d "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/postgres" ] || init_db
}
```
**Best practices:**
- No overlapping vars, services, or function names
- Use explicit, namespaced naming (e.g., `postgres_init` not `init`)
- Minimal hook logic (composed envs run ALL hooks)
- Avoid auto-run logic in `[profile]` (runs once per layer/composition; help displays will repeat); see §4b
- Test composability: `flox activate` each env standalone first

**CUDA composition example:** Compose base CUDA, math libraries, and ML frameworks into reproducible stack:
```toml
[include]
environments = [
    { remote = "team/cuda-base" },
    { remote = "team/cuda-math" },
    { remote = "team/python-ml" }
]
```

### Creating Dual-Purpose Environments
**Design for both patterns:**
```toml
[install]
# Clear package groups
python.pkg-path = "python311"
python.pkg-group = "runtime"

[vars]
# Namespace everything
MYPROJECT_VERSION = "1.0"
MYPROJECT_CONFIG = "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/config"

[profile.common]
# Defensive function definitions
if ! type myproject_init >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  myproject_init() { ... }
fi
```

### Usage Examples
- **Layer**: `flox activate -r team/postgres -- flox activate -r team/debug`
- **Compose**: `[include] environments = [{ remote = "team/postgres" }]`
- **Both**: Compose base, layer tools on top

## 13 Containerization

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Export to file
flox containerize -f ./mycontainer.tar
docker load -i ./mycontainer.tar

# Export directly to runtime (auto-detects docker/podman)
flox containerize --runtime docker

# Pipe to stdout
flox containerize -f - | docker load

# Tag container
flox containerize --tag v1.0 -f - | docker load
```

### How Containers Behave
**Containers activate the Flox environment on startup** (like `flox activate`):
- **Interactive**: `docker run -it <image>` → Bash **subshell** with environment activated after hook runs
- **Non-interactive**: `docker run <image> <cmd>` → Runs command **without subshell** (like `flox activate -- <cmd>`)
- All packages, variables, and hooks are available inside the container
- Flox sets an entrypoint that activates the environment; `cmd` runs inside that activation

### Command Options
```bash
flox containerize
  [-f <file>]           # Output file (- for stdout); defaults to {name}-container.tar
  [--runtime <runtime>] # docker/podman (auto-detects if not specified)
  [--tag <tag>]         # Container tag (e.g., v1.0, latest)
  [-d <path>]           # Path to .flox/ directory
  [-r <owner/name>]     # Remote environment from FloxHub
```

### Manifest Configuration

**Warning**: `[containerize.config]` is **experimental** and its behavior is subject to change.

Configure container in `[containerize.config]`:

```toml
[containerize.config]
user = "appuser"                    # Username or uid:gid format
                                     # Auto-creates /etc/passwd and /etc/groups entries (no manual useradd needed)
exposed-ports = ["8080/tcp"]        # Ports to expose (tcp/udp; default: tcp)
cmd = ["python", "app.py"]          # Default command (overridable at container runtime; receives activated env)
volumes = ["/data", "/config"]      # Mount points for persistent data
working-dir = "/app"                # Working directory (overridable at container runtime)
labels = { version = "1.0" }        # Arbitrary metadata (must follow OCI annotation rules)
stop-signal = "SIGTERM"             # Signal to stop container (must follow OCI annotation rules)
```

### Complete Workflow Example
```bash
# Create environment
flox init
flox install python311 flask

# Configure for container
cat >> .flox/env/manifest.toml << 'EOF'
[containerize.config]
exposed-ports = ["5000/tcp"]
cmd = ["python", "-m", "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
working-dir = "/app"
EOF

# Build and run
flox containerize -f - | docker load
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/app <container-id>
```

### Platform-Specific Notes
**macOS**:
- **Requires** docker/podman runtime (uses proxy container for builds)
- May prompt for file sharing permissions during first build
- Creates `flox-nix` volume for caching build artifacts
- **Cleanup**: Remove volume when no `flox containerize` command is running:
  ```bash
  docker volume rm flox-nix    # for Docker
  podman volume rm flox-nix    # for Podman
  ```

**Linux**: Direct image creation without proxy

### Common Patterns

**Service containers**:
```toml
[services.web]
command = "python -m http.server 8000"

[containerize.config]
exposed-ports = ["8000/tcp"]
cmd = []  # Service starts automatically
```

**Multi-stage pattern** (build in one env, run in another):
```bash
# Build environment with all dev tools
flox activate -d ./build-env -- flox build myapp

# Runtime environment with minimal deps
cd ./runtime-env
flox install myapp
flox containerize --tag production
```

**Remote environment containers**:
```bash
# Containerize shared team environment
flox containerize -r team/python-ml --tag latest
```

### Container Execution Patterns

**Interactive with automatic cleanup**:
```bash
$ flox init
$ flox install hello
$ flox containerize -f - | docker load
$ docker run --rm -it <container-id>
[floxenv] $ hello
Hello, world!
```

**Non-interactive command** (no subshell):
```bash
$ flox containerize -f - | docker load
$ docker run <container-id> hello
Hello, world
```

**Tagged container access**:
```bash
$ flox containerize --tag v1 -f - | docker load
$ docker run --rm -it <container-name>:v1
[floxenv] $ hello
Hello, world!
```

**Custom docker path** (when docker not in PATH):
```bash
$ flox containerize -f - | /path/to/docker load
```

**Kubernetes deployment**: For deploying Flox environments to Kubernetes clusters without building images, see §15 (Kubernetes Deployment).

## 14 CI/CD Integration

Same environment locally and in CI. Cross-platform, reproducible by default. Commit `.flox/env/manifest.toml` and `.flox/env.json` to source control.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Method | Usage |
|----------|--------|-------|
| GitHub Actions | `flox/install-flox-action` + `flox/activate-action` | Declarative |
| CircleCI | `flox/orb@1.0.0` | `flox/install` + `flox/activate` |
| GitLab | `ghcr.io/flox/flox:latest` container | Direct CLI |
| Generic | Install from flox.dev | Shell scripts |

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: flox/install-flox-action@v2
      - uses: flox/activate-action@v1
        with:
          command: npm run build
```

### CircleCI
```yaml
orbs:
  flox: flox/orb@1.0.0
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - flox/install
      - flox/activate:
          command: npm run build
```

### GitLab / Generic Shell
```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
image: ghcr.io/flox/flox:latest
build:
  script:
    - eval "$(flox activate)"
    - npm run build
```

**Shell pattern** (complex scripts, loops):
```bash
eval "$(flox activate)"
# All subsequent commands run in environment
```

**Subprocess pattern** (single commands):
```bash
flox activate -- npm run build
```

### Authentication (Private Environments)

**When required:** `flox activate -r team/private`, `flox publish`, `flox push/pull --remote`

**Setup:** Create service credentials at https://flox.dev/docs/tutorials/ci-cd/, store as `FLOXHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `FLOXHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` secrets.

**GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
- name: Auth FloxHub
  run: |
    export FLOX_FLOXHUB_TOKEN=$(
      curl --fail --request POST \
        --url https://auth.flox.dev/oauth/token \
        --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
        --data "client_id=${{ secrets.FLOXHUB_CLIENT_ID }}" \
        --data "audience=https://hub.flox.dev/api" \
        --data "grant_type=client_credentials" \
        --data "client_secret=${{ secrets.FLOXHUB_CLIENT_SECRET }}" \
          | jq -e .access_token -r)
    flox auth status
    echo "FLOX_FLOXHUB_TOKEN=$FLOX_FLOXHUB_TOKEN" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

**Critical:** `audience` must be exactly `https://hub.flox.dev/api`. Token persists via `$GITHUB_ENV` (Actions), `$BASH_ENV` (CircleCI), or `variables:` (GitLab).

### Best Practices
- Pin versions in CI: `version = "1.2.3"` not `"^1.2"`
- Disable metrics: `FLOX_DISABLE_METRICS="true"`
- Cache `~/.cache/flox` keyed on manifest checksum
- Use `sandbox = "pure"` for published packages (§9.2)
- Multi-arch: Same manifest works x86_64/arm64; use matrix builds
- Auth per-job: Tokens expire; don't cache between jobs

### Common Patterns
```yaml
# Containerize and push
- flox/activate-action:
    command: flox containerize --runtime docker --tag v1.0

# Multi-platform
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]

# Conditional publish (main branch only)
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

### Common Gotchas
- GitHub Actions: Must `flox/install-flox-action` before `flox/activate-action`
- Auth: Token required BEFORE accessing private envs; fails silently otherwise
- Token persistence: Use platform-specific env export (`$GITHUB_ENV`, `$BASH_ENV`)
- Manifest changes: Commit `.flox/env.json` after `flox install`; CI doesn't auto-update
- Services: Use `flox activate -s` for background services (§8)
- Build hooks don't run during `flox build` (§9.1)

## 15 Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy Flox environments to Kubernetes clusters using imageless containers - from local testing through production.

### Overview

Instead of building and pushing container images, reference Flox environments directly in Pod specs. The Kubernetes cluster pulls environments from FloxHub at pod start. This works identically across local (kind/colima/k3s), CI, and production clusters.

**Benefits**:
- No image rebuild cycles - update environment, redeploy pod
- FloxHub as source of truth - centralized package versions, audit trail
- Consistency guarantee - same dependencies in dev, CI, and production
- Fast iteration - install package to environment → redeploy → new generation live
- Production-ready - same pattern from laptop to prod cluster

### Prerequisites

**Install Flox on cluster nodes**:
```bash
# See https://flox.dev/docs/install for your platform
```

**Install runtime shim** (automatic):
```bash
# Run on each node (or in node provisioning script)
sudo flox activate -r flox/containerd-shim-flox-installer --trust
```

**Manual installation** (k3s, custom containerd, or if automatic fails):
```bash
# Create environment with shim
mkdir containerd-shim-flox && cd containerd-shim-flox
flox init -b
flox install containerd-shim-flox-2x  # Use -17 for containerd 1.7

# Symlink to system path
sudo ln -s $PWD/.flox/run/x86_64-linux.containerd-shim-flox.run/bin/containerd-shim-flox-v2 \
  /usr/local/bin/containerd-shim-flox-v2
```

**Configure containerd** (add to `/etc/containerd/config.toml`):
```toml
# For containerd 2.x (version = 2)
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.flox]
    runtime_path = "/usr/local/bin/containerd-shim-flox-v2"
    runtime_type = "io.containerd.runc.v2"
    pod_annotations = [ "flox.dev/*" ]
    container_annotations = [ "flox.dev/*" ]
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.flox.options]
    SystemdCgroup = true

# For containerd 1.x (version = 3), use:
# [plugins."io.containerd.cri.v1.runtime".containerd.runtimes.flox]
```

```bash
# Restart containerd
sudo systemctl restart containerd
# For k3s: sudo systemctl restart k3s
```

**Verify shim installation**:
```bash
containerd config dump | grep -A 10 "flox"
```

### Kubernetes Setup

**Label nodes** that have Flox runtime installed:
```bash
kubectl label node <node-name> "flox.dev/enabled=true"
```

**Create RuntimeClass**:
```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: flox
handler: flox
scheduling:
  nodeSelector:
    flox.dev/enabled: "true"
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f RuntimeClass.yaml
```

### Pod Configuration

**Basic Pod spec** using Flox environment:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
  annotations:
    flox.dev/environment: "owner/myenv"      # FloxHub environment
    # flox.dev/disable-metrics: "true"       # Optional: disable metrics
spec:
  runtimeClassName: flox                     # Required: use Flox runtime
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: flox/empty:1.0.0                # Required stub (49 bytes)
      command: ["python", "app.py"]          # Runs inside Flox environment
```

**Deployment manifest** (production pattern):
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
      annotations:
        flox.dev/environment: "myorg/prod-env@12"  # Pin to generation
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: flox
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: flox/empty:1.0.0
          command: ["python", "-m", "flask", "run"]
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
```

### Development Workflow

**Local → CI → Production pattern**:

**1. Develop and test locally**:
```bash
flox init
flox install python311 flask requests
flox activate -- python app.py  # Test locally first
```

**2. Push to FloxHub** (becomes source of truth):
```bash
flox push
# Environment available as owner/myenv
# FloxHub tracks: packages, versions, variables, scripts, audit trail
```

**3. Test in local cluster** (kind/colima/minikube):
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml  # References owner/myenv
kubectl logs myapp
```

**4. Deploy to CI cluster**:
```bash
# Same Pod spec works in CI cluster
kubectl --context=ci-cluster apply -f deployment.yaml
```

**5. Promote to production**:
```bash
# Pin to tested generation for production
# Update annotation: flox.dev/environment: "owner/myenv@12"
kubectl --context=prod-cluster apply -f deployment.yaml
```

**6. Iterate without rebuilding images**:
```bash
# Add dependency
flox install -r owner/myenv boto3

# This creates new generation (e.g., @13) automatically
# Update deployment to use new generation
kubectl rollout restart deployment/myapp
```

**No Docker build, no registry push, no image tagging** - environment updates propagate through FloxHub.

### Generation Pinning Strategies

**Latest generation** (development/staging):
```yaml
flox.dev/environment: "owner/myenv"  # Always pulls latest
```

**Pinned generation** (production):
```yaml
flox.dev/environment: "owner/myenv@12"  # Immutable, reproducible
```

**Digest pinning** (maximum reproducibility):
```yaml
flox.dev/environment: "owner/myenv@sha256:abc123..."
```

### Testing Multiple Versions

A/B test dependency versions simultaneously:
```yaml
# deployment-variant-a.yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    flox.dev/environment: "owner/ml-model@10"  # torch 2.0

# deployment-variant-b.yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    flox.dev/environment: "owner/ml-model@11"  # torch 2.1
```

Both deployments share cached dependencies on nodes; only diffs are pulled.

### CVE Remediation Workflow

**1. Identify affected environments**:
```bash
# Query FloxHub for environments with vulnerable package
flox search --environment owner/myenv openssl@1.1.1
```

**2. Update environment**:
```bash
flox install -r owner/myenv openssl@3.0.0
# Creates new generation with patched package
```

**3. Test in non-production**:
```bash
# Update staging deployment to new generation
kubectl --context=staging patch deployment myapp -p \
  '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"flox.dev/environment":"owner/myenv@13"}}}}}'
```

**4. Roll out to production**:
```bash
# After validation, update production
kubectl --context=prod patch deployment myapp -p \
  '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"flox.dev/environment":"owner/myenv@13"}}}}}'
```

**5. Rollback if needed** (instant, no image rebuild):
```bash
kubectl --context=prod patch deployment myapp -p \
  '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"flox.dev/environment":"owner/myenv@12"}}}}}'
```

### How It Works

**Pod startup flow**:
1. Pod spec sets `runtimeClassName: flox` and `flox.dev/environment` annotation
2. Kubelet routes pod to Flox runtime shim via RuntimeClass
3. Shim pulls environment from FloxHub (if not cached on node)
4. Shim mounts dependencies from `/nix/store` into container
5. Shim wraps container command to run in Flox activation context
6. Container starts with `flox/empty:1.0.0` stub image (49 bytes)
7. Command executes inside Flox environment (like `flox activate -- cmd`)

**Node caching**: Dependencies cached in `/nix/store` are reused across all pods on that node. First pod pulls packages; subsequent pods with same environment start instantly.

### Troubleshooting

**Pods stuck in ContainerCreating**:
```bash
# Verify shim registered with containerd
containerd config dump | grep -A 10 "flox"

# Check node has proper label
kubectl get nodes -L flox.dev/enabled

# View containerd logs
journalctl -u containerd -n 50

# For k3s
journalctl -u k3s -n 50
```

**Verify RuntimeClass exists**:
```bash
kubectl get runtimeclass flox -o yaml
```

**Check pod events**:
```bash
kubectl describe pod myapp
# Look for events mentioning runtime or containerd
```

**Configuration conflicts** (NVIDIA toolkit, etc.):
```bash
# Check if imported configs override Flox settings
containerd config dump | grep imports
# If present, manually add Flox config to imported files
```

**Environment pull failures**:
```bash
# Check FloxHub authentication on node
ssh node-name
flox auth status

# Verify environment exists
flox show owner/myenv
```

### Upgrading

**Upgrade Flox runtime shim**:
```bash
# Run on each node
sudo flox activate -r flox/containerd-shim-flox-installer --trust

# Restart existing pods to use new shim
kubectl rollout restart deployment/myapp
```

**Upgrade Flox** on nodes:
```bash
# See https://flox.dev/docs/install for platform-specific upgrade
```

**Note**: Pods must be restarted to use upgraded shim version.

### Production Considerations

**Node provisioning**: Include shim installation in node bootstrap scripts or AMIs.

**FloxHub authentication** for private environments:
```bash
# On each node, configure service account
flox auth login --token $FLOXHUB_TOKEN
```

Store tokens in secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.) and inject during node provisioning.

**Monitoring**: Shim logs to node's containerd logs accessible via `journalctl -u containerd`.

**Security**: RuntimeClass `nodeSelector` prevents pods from scheduling on nodes without Flox runtime.

**Scaling**: `/nix/store` cache is per-node. Consider:
- Node pool strategies (dedicated pools for Flox workloads)
- Persistent volumes for `/nix/store` (optional, for faster node replacement)

**Managed Kubernetes differences**:
- **EKS**: Use launch templates for shim installation; configure IAM for FloxHub access
- **GKE**: Use node startup scripts; configure workload identity for FloxHub
- **AKS**: Use VM scale set extensions; configure managed identity for FloxHub

See https://flox.dev/docs/k8s for platform-specific setup guides.

## 16 Environment Variable Convention Example

- Use variables like `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT` to define where services run.
- These store connection details *separately*:
  - `*_HOST` is the hostname or IP address (e.g., `localhost`, `db.example.com`).
  - `*_PORT` is the network port number (e.g., `5432`, `6379`).
- This pattern ensures users can override them at runtime:
  ```bash
  POSTGRES_HOST=db.internal POSTGRES_PORT=6543 flox activate
  ```
- Use consistent naming across services so the meaning is clear to any system or person reading the variables.

## 17 Quick Tips for [install] Section
- **Tricky Dependencies**: If we need `libstdc++`, we get this from the `gcc-unwrapped` package, not from `gcc`; if we need to have both in the same environment, we use either package groups or assign priorities. (See **`Conflicts`**, below); also, if user is working with python and requests `uv`, they typically do not mean `uvicorn`; clarify which package user wants.
- **Conflicts**: If packages conflict, use different `pkg-group` values or adjust `priority`. **CUDA packages require explicit priorities** (see §18d).
- **Versions**: Start loose (`"^1.0"`), tighten if needed (`"1.2.3"`)
- **Platforms**: Only restrict `systems` when package is platform-specific. **CUDA is Linux-only**: `["aarch64-linux", "x86_64-linux"]`
- **Naming**: Install ID can differ from pkg-path (e.g., `gcc.pkg-path = "gcc13"`)
- **Search**: Use `flox search` to find correct pkg-paths before installing

## 18 Language-Specific Dev Patterns

## 18a Python and Python Virtual Environments
  - **venv creation pattern**: Always check existence before activation - `uv venv` may not complete synchronously:
    ```bash
    if [ ! -d "$venv" ]; then
      uv venv "$venv" --python python3
    fi
    # Guard activation - venv creation might not be complete
    if [ -f "$venv/bin/activate" ]; then
      source "$venv/bin/activate"
    fi
	```
  **venv location**: Always use $FLOX_ENV_CACHE/venv - survives environment rebuilds
  **uv with venv**: Use `uv pip install --python "$venv/bin/python"` NOT `"$venv/bin/python" -m uv`
  **Service commands**: Use venv Python directly: $FLOX_ENV_CACHE/venv/bin/python not python
- **Activation**: Always `source "$venv/bin/activate"` before pip/uv operations
- **PyTorch CUDA**: Install with `--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124` for GPU support (see §18d)
- **PyTorch gotcha**: Needs `gcc-unwrapped` for libstdc++.so.6, not just `gcc`
- **PyTorch CPU/GPU**: Use separate index URLs: `/whl/cpu` vs `/whl/cu124` (don't mix!)
- **Service scripts**: Must activate venv inside service command, not rely on hook activation
- **Cache dirs**: Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` and `PIP_CACHE_DIR` to `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE` subdirs
- **Dependency installation flag**: Touch `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/.deps_installed` to prevent reinstalls
- **Service venv pattern**: Always use absolute paths and explicit activation in service commands:
  ```toml
  [services.myapp]
  command = '''
  source "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/venv/bin/activate"
  exec "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/venv/bin/python" app.py
  '''
  ```
- **Using Python packages from catalog**: Override data dirs to use local paths:
  ```toml
  [install]
  myapp.pkg-path = "owner/myapp"
  [vars]
  MYAPP_DATA = "$FLOX_ENV_PROJECT"  # Use repo not ~/.myapp
  ```
- **Wrapping package commands**: Alias to customize behavior:
  ```bash
  # In [profile]
  alias myapp-setup="MYAPP_DATA=$FLOX_ENV_PROJECT command myapp-setup"
  ```

**Note**: `uv` is installed in the Flox environment, not inside the venv. We use `uv pip install --python "$venv/bin/python"` so that `uv` targets the venv's Python interpreter.

## 18b C/C++ Development Environments
- **Package Names**: `gbenchmark` not `benchmark`, `catch2_3` for Catch2, `gcc13`/`clang_18` for specific versions
- **System Constraints**: Linux-only tools need explicit systems: `valgrind.systems = ["x86_64-linux", "aarch64-linux"]`
- **Essential Groups**: Separate `compilers`, `build`, `debug`, `testing`, `libraries` groups prevent conflicts
- **Core Stack**: gcc13/clang_18, cmake/ninja/make, gdb/lldb, boost/eigen/fmt/spdlog, gtest/catch2/gbenchmark
- **libstdc++ Access**: ALWAYS include `gcc-unwrapped` for C++ stdlib headers/libs (gcc alone doesn't expose them):
```toml
gcc-unwrapped.pkg-path = "gcc-unwrapped"
gcc-unwrapped.priority = 5  # Lower priority to avoid conflicts
gcc-unwrapped.pkg-group = "libraries"
```

## 18c Node.js Development Environments
- **Package managers**: Install `nodejs` (includes npm); add `yarn` or `pnpm` separately if needed
- **Version pinning**: Use `version = "^20.0"` for LTS, or exact versions for reproducibility
- **Global tools pattern**: Use `npx` for one-off tools, install commonly-used globals in manifest
- **Service pattern**: Always specify host/port for network services:
  ```toml
  [services.dev-server]
  command = '''exec npm run dev -- --host "$DEV_HOST" --port "$DEV_PORT"'''
  ```

## 18d CUDA Development Environments

### Prerequisites & Authentication
- Sign up for early access at https://flox.dev, authenticate with `flox auth login`
- **Linux-only**: CUDA packages only work on `["aarch64-linux", "x86_64-linux"]`
- All CUDA packages are prefixed with `flox-cuda/` in the catalog

### Package Discovery
```bash
flox search cudatoolkit --all | grep flox-cuda
flox search nvcc --all | grep 12_8              # Specific versions
flox show flox-cuda/cudaPackages.cudatoolkit    # All available versions
```

### Essential CUDA Packages
| Package Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| `cudaPackages_X_Y.cudatoolkit` | Main CUDA Toolkit | `cudaPackages_12_8.cudatoolkit` |
| `cudaPackages_X_Y.cuda_nvcc` | NVIDIA C++ Compiler | `cudaPackages_12_8.cuda_nvcc` |
| `cudaPackages.cuda_cudart` | CUDA Runtime API | `cuda_cudart` |
| `cudaPackages_X_Y.libcublas` | Linear algebra | `cudaPackages_12_8.libcublas` |
| `cudaPackages_X_Y.cudnn_9_11` | Deep neural networks | `cudaPackages_12_8.cudnn_9_11` |

### Critical: Conflict Resolution
**CUDA packages have LICENSE file conflicts requiring explicit priorities:**
```toml
[install]
cuda_nvcc.pkg-path = "flox-cuda/cudaPackages_12_8.cuda_nvcc"
cuda_nvcc.systems = ["aarch64-linux", "x86_64-linux"]
cuda_nvcc.priority = 1                    # Highest priority

cuda_cudart.pkg-path = "flox-cuda/cudaPackages.cuda_cudart"
cuda_cudart.systems = ["aarch64-linux", "x86_64-linux"]
cuda_cudart.priority = 2

cudatoolkit.pkg-path = "flox-cuda/cudaPackages_12_8.cudatoolkit"
cudatoolkit.systems = ["aarch64-linux", "x86_64-linux"]
cudatoolkit.priority = 3                  # Lower for LICENSE conflicts

gcc.pkg-path = "gcc"
gcc-unwrapped.pkg-path = "gcc-unwrapped"  # For libstdc++
gcc-unwrapped.priority = 5
```

### Cross-Platform GPU Development
Dual CUDA/CPU packages for portability (Linux gets CUDA, macOS gets CPU fallback):
```toml
[install]
## CUDA packages (Linux only)
cuda-pytorch.pkg-path = "flox-cuda/python3Packages.torch"
cuda-pytorch.systems = ["x86_64-linux", "aarch64-linux"]
cuda-pytorch.priority = 1

## Non-CUDA packages (macOS + Linux fallback)
pytorch.pkg-path = "python313Packages.pytorch"
pytorch.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"]
pytorch.priority = 6                     # Lower priority

### GPU Detection Pattern
**Dynamic CPU/GPU package installation in hooks:**
```bash
setup_gpu_packages() {
  venv="$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/venv"
  
  if [ ! -f "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/.deps_installed" ]; then
    if lspci 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'NVIDIA|AMD' > /dev/null; then
      echo "GPU detected, installing CUDA packages"
      uv pip install --python "$venv/bin/python" \
        torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129
    else
      echo "No GPU detected, installing CPU packages"
      uv pip install --python "$venv/bin/python" \
        torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    fi
    touch "$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/.deps_installed"
  fi
}
```

### Best Practices
- **Always use priority values**: CUDA packages have predictable conflicts
- **Version consistency**: Use specific versions (e.g., `_12_8`) for reproducibility
- **Modular design**: Split base CUDA, math libs, debugging into separate environments
- **Test compilation**: Verify `nvcc hello.cu -o hello` works after setup
- **Platform constraints**: Always include `systems = ["aarch64-linux", "x86_64-linux"]`

### Common CUDA Gotchas
- **CUDA toolkit ≠ complete toolkit**: Add libraries (libcublas, cudnn) as needed
- **License conflicts**: Every CUDA package may need explicit priority
- **No macOS support**: Use Metal alternatives on Darwin
- **Version mixing**: Don't mix CUDA versions; use consistent `_X_Y` suffixes

### Complete Example
```toml
[install]
cuda_nvcc.pkg-path = "flox-cuda/cudaPackages_12_8.cuda_nvcc"
cuda_nvcc.priority = 1
cuda_cudart.pkg-path = "flox-cuda/cudaPackages.cuda_cudart"
cuda_cudart.priority = 2
libcublas.pkg-path = "flox-cuda/cudaPackages.libcublas"
torch.pkg-path = "flox-cuda/python3Packages.torch"
python313Full.pkg-path = "python313Full"
uv.pkg-path = "uv"
gcc.pkg-path = "gcc"
gcc-unwrapped.pkg-path = "gcc-unwrapped"
gcc-unwrapped.priority = 5

[vars]
CUDA_VERSION = "12.8"
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF = "max_split_size_mb:128"

[hook]
setup_cuda_venv() {
  venv="$FLOX_ENV_CACHE/venv"
  [ ! -d "$venv" ] && uv venv "$venv" --python python3
  [ -f "$venv/bin/activate" ] && source "$venv/bin/activate"
}
```

## 19 **Platform-Specific Pattern**:
```toml
# Darwin-specific frameworks and tools
IOKit.pkg-path = "darwin.apple_sdk.frameworks.IOKit"
IOKit.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"]
CoreFoundation.pkg-path = "darwin.apple_sdk.frameworks.CoreFoundation"
CoreFoundation.priority = 2
CoreFoundation.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"]

# Platform-preferred compilers (remove constraints if cross-platform needed)
gcc.pkg-path = "gcc"
gcc.systems = ["x86_64-linux", "aarch64-linux"]
clang.pkg-path = "clang" 
clang.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"]

# Darwin GNU compatibility layer (Darwin's built-ins are ancient/limited)
coreutils.pkg-path = "coreutils"
coreutils.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"]
gnumake.pkg-path = "gnumake"
gnumake.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"] 
gnused.pkg-path = "gnused"
gnused.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"]
gawk.pkg-path = "gawk"
gawk.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"]
bashInteractive.pkg-path = "bashInteractive"
bashInteractive.systems = ["x86_64-darwin", "aarch64-darwin"]
```

**Note**: CUDA is Linux-only (see §18d); use Metal-accelerated packages on Darwin when available.
